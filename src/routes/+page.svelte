    This page is created by using <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> framework.
    This is a very simple page which just renders my writing into a simple page.
    It's just better for me.<br>

        The Operating System I just like the GNU/Linux OS, I've tried MacOS and Microsoft Windows before but it just doesn't work for me, i mean the tiling window manager, unbloated program (Well if u use arch is just a base program), and the main thing about linux that is free, But there's downside using linux, You can't use Microsoft Office. Still, it is the best OS I've ever tried. <br>
