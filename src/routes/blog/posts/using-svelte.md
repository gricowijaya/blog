Hello, for creating this entire front-end we can create the Svelte for creating this blog. Well I'm still learn about the front end because I've not practice it in many years.

Let's put an emoji here: ðŸ˜Ž

Let's create the hello world program just like below

```javascript
const hello =  "Hello World!";

console.log(hello);
```

Now use the Go Lang
```go
package main

import("fmt")

func main() { 
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

Here's some intro using the svelte, I enjoy using it.
